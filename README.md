## Features
1. Rotating proxies on a per-scraper basis
2. Search filters, which SearxNG lacks for the most part
3. Bot protection that *actually* filters out the bots (when configured)
4. Interface doesn't require javascript
5. Favicon fetcher with caching support & image proxy
6. Bunch of other shit

tl;dr the best way to actually browse for shit.
