## Totally unbiased comparison between alternatives

|                            | 4get                    | searx(ng) | libreY      | araa      | hearch.co         |
|----------------------------|-------------------------|-----------|-------------|-----------|-------------------|
| RAM usage                  | 200-400mb~              | 2GB~      | 200-400mb~  | 2GB~      | idk               |
| Does it suck               | no (debunked by snopes) | yes       | yes         | a little  | better than searx |
| Does it work               | ye                      | sometimes | sometimes   | sometimes | yes               |

## Features
1. Rotating proxies on a per-scraper basis
2. Search filters, which SearxNG lacks for the most part
3. Bot protection that *actually* filters out the bots (when configured)
4. Interface doesn't require javascript
5. Favicon fetcher with caching support & image proxy
6. Bunch of other shits

tl;dr 4get is the best way to browse for shit.
